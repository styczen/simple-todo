This one I want to use as my daily TODO app, because I want
"My Day" tab to automatically fill with tasks from "All tasks"
tab when I refresh. At first I will try to run server locally
on Raspberry Pi 3b and sync with storage when I am connected
to my local WiFi.

DISCLAIMER 1: I have no idea how to make good UI at all, so there might
be some very stupid things done there 

DISCLAIMER 2: I know that there are a lot of ready
components e.g. in react-native-elements but I want to do something on my own
(at least this time)

## Backend TODOs
- Write some tests for backend,

## Frontend TODOs
- Create simplest/usable UI possible
- Store current data locally when not connected to server
- When simple UI is done and other stuff is finished, make UI better
